## 1. Development of Bitcoin
The concept of Bitcoin was first proposed by Nakamoto on November 1, 2008, and was formally born on January 3, 2009. Relying on the open source software designed and released by Zhongbencong and the P2P network constructed, Bitcoin came into being as a virtual encrypted digital currency in the form of P2P.

Bitcoin started with cryptography enthusiasts and cyberliberals. Its acquisition process is similar to the reward of cloud computing network puzzle-solving games. It has no market value and belongs to their hobbies. Subsequently, under the dual effects of pioneer demonstration and media publicity, the functions and characteristics of Bitcoin have been gradually discovered. As a result, the recipients have gradually moved from a small circle to the public, and the number of recipients and transactions has been increasing. The value of Bitcoin has also begun to fluctuate sharply but rising rapidly. The development of Bitcoin is shown in the following figure.  

As a new currency, the public, scholars and the government have different views on Bitcoin. Proponents believe that it has the characteristics of the world currency, indicating the future of the monetary system; the opponents believe that it can not overcome its own shortcomings, prosperity is just a bubble, and will eventually burst. Although different governments have different definitions of Bitcoin, they mostly adopt policies that neither support nor completely prohibit Bitcoin, with some reservations. As a result, Bitcoin's market has always been volatile, because no one has the absolute advantage. 

## 2. Literature Research on Bitcoin
The research of Bitcoin in academic circles is mainly carried out at three levels: technology, economics and law. Among them, in the economic level, mainly around the four directions.

One is the introduction of Bitcoin's principle, characteristics, empirical research and forecasting analysis. Zhao Yandong et al. (2014) analyzed the credit characteristics of Bitcoin and its trading mode with RMB, believing that Bitcoin has certain investment value, but will not become the legal currency in the real world. Wu Hong et al. (2013) analyzed the background and reasons for the emergence of Bitcoin, compared and found that Bitcoin and gold index data in a certain period of time basically synchronized, providing the possibility that Bitcoin can act as a digital currency. 


The second is the research on the internal structure and development trend of Bit coin. Teigland et al. (2013) took the Bitcoin community as an institutionalized enterprise, analyzed its organizational structure and network structure, pointed out its strong self-repairing characteristics; Kondor et al. (2013) studied the evolution characteristics of its network structure and currency distribution through the empirical analysis of the time series of Bitcoin network characteristic data. 

The third is to conbine the economic theories such as monetary principles with the emergence of Bitcoin. Luther (2013) believes that money is essentially a recording tool for human behavior, and Bitcoin is returning to that essence. Selgin (2013) believes that Bitcoin belongs to man-made commodity currencies and has the potential to become a currency which does not need to be regulated and is conducive to maintaining macroeconomic stability. Sun et al. (2014) analyzed the characteristics of Bitcoin in the world currency, and concluded that Bitcoin has the characteristics of world currency. 

The fourth is to analyse the economic impact of Bitcoin and puts forward suggestions on regulation. Bryans (2013), ELIAS (2013) , Gruber (2013) and others have carried out research on the regulation of tax avoidance, money laundering and anonymous transactions of Bitcoin.
